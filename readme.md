# Particle Flow Filter and Differentiable Particle Filter

This repository contains the code and the report for the JP Morgan MLCOE TSRL 2026 internship question 2 written by Younghwan Cho.

## Overview

We provide a mini-research on particle flow filters and their recent advancements based on GPU-based automatic differentiation.
The repository will begin with the replication of fundamental methods in state estimation, e.g., Kalman filter, Unscented Kalman Filter, and move on to much more advanced topics.
